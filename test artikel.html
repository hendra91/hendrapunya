<h3>Find an Exchange</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there is no official Bitcoin exchange. Users have many choices and should consider the following factors when deciding on an exchange:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Regulation & Trust –</b> Is the exchange trustworthy? Could the exchange run away with customer funds?</li>
	<li><b>Location –</b> If you must deposit fiat currency, and exchange that accepts payments from your country is required.</li>
	<li><b>Fees -</b> What percent of each trade is charged?</li>
	<li><b>Liquidity –</b> Large traders will need a Bitcoin exchange with high liquidity and good market depth.</li>
</ul>
